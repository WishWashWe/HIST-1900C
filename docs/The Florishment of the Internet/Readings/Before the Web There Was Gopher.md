### Summary & Key Take Aways

Philip Frana's article "Before the Web There Was Gopher" discusses the history and decline of the Gopher protocol, which was created in 1991 as a means of accessing and sharing information on the internet through a hierarchical menu system. While Gopher was popular in the early 1990s due to its ease of use, it ultimately declined in popularity due to limitations in its ability to handle multimedia content and the commercialization of the World Wide Web. By the late 1990s, Gopher had largely been replaced by the web.

- **The Gopher protocol is a communication protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks
	- The World Wide Web, universally well known today, was preceded by an efficient software tool that was fondly named Gopher. The Internet Gopher, much like the Web, enabled users to obtain information quickly and easily. Why, then, did it disappear but the Web did not? Gopher faded into obscurity for two main reasons: hypertext and commerce.**

Frana describes how Gopher quickly gained popularity in the early 1990s, as it was much easier to use than the text-based interfaces that existed at the time. He also notes that Gopher was originally designed as a non-commercial, open system, in contrast to the commercialization of the World Wide Web.
- However, as the World Wide Web grew in popularity, Gopher's user base declined. The protocol was also limited in its ability to handle multimedia content, which became increasingly important on the web. By the late 1990s, Gopher had largely been replaced by the web.

Despite Gopher's decline, Frana argues that Gopher played an important role in the development of the internet, and that it is still used today by some niche communities. He also suggests that Gopher's emphasis on simplicity and open access could provide lessons for the future of the internet
