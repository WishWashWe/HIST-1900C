### Summary & Key Take Aways
"The Internet Myth: From the Internet Imaginary to Network Ideologies," by Paolo Bory, is a critical examination of the internet's cultural, social, and political elements. In Chapters 1 and 2, Bory talks about the "internet imaginary" and how it has changed, as well as how "network ideologies" have emerged.

- Chapter 1 gives an outline of the historical and cultural background behind the development of the internet. Bory asserts that the online imaginary is a critical component of the internet's cultural history, having been moulded by many discourses and ideologies. Bory puts down the basis for a critical examination of the internet and its cultural, social, and political significance by following the evolution of these discourses.

- Chapter 2 offers a critique of the "Myth of the World Wide Web" as well as the growth of network ideologies in the 1990s. Networks, according to Bory, are not inherently democratic, but rather centres of power and control. Bory provides the framework for a more thorough understanding of the internet and its cultural, social, and political significance by challenging the myth of the World Wide Web.
