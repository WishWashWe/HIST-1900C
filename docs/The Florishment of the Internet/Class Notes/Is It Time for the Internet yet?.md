#### Attributes that allowed the Internet to Exsist:
-   Digital computers
-   Telecommunication networks
-   Ideas around flow control, logic, algorithms
-   Demonstration of control of a calculator over a phone line in 1940

- **Information Theory** : allows us to separate meaning of a message from its 'information', the measure of its redundancy, hence, the amount of damage it can take and still be understood.
	- Without that insight, nothing else can work. It's what makes digital communications _work_.

- **Timesharing :** technique for using the speed of the computer to present the appearance of multiple simultaneous users

- **The Modem**: The sole purpose of the modem is **to provide you with internet access**. If you were to only have one internet-connected device with an Ethernet port (such as a desktop computer), you could connect the modem directly to your computer with no need for a router

##### QUESTIONS OF THE TIME

Which computer to use?

How to effectively get your data into and out of that computer?

Discrete circuits? Or something else?

##### AWNSERS OF THE TIME

**Packet Switching**
-   developed independently in US, and in UK, at the same time
-   only one of these was framed in the context of surviving nuclear war

##### US Political Context**
At the time America was under the tention of nuclear war.
-   Paul Baran engineer at the [Rand](https://www.rand.org/) Corporation, begins thinking about secure communications in case of a nuclear emergency
- Baran's original system was the simplest system:	go/no go 
		 via am radio to commanders in the field: nuke or no nuke.

His Second Idea was using **Distributed Communication**
- Regular Communication
	- 'hierarchy call to local office <-> regional <-> national <-> regional and back
		- destroy local/regional/national office, comms cut off
- **Distributed Communication**- nodes and switches- destroy node, still other paths

**Store and foward**
- Controlling data flow - "message switching"
**Packet switching**
- 'distributed adaptive messaging block switching. The data pakets take diffrent routes to their destination

This wasnt a new idea, Telephone switches used information theory to figure out least congested routes to wire a circuit
ex: The CONUS AUTOVON

-   ARPA - Advanced Research Projects Agency - _oh shit Sputnik!_ - created 1957
-   AT&T greet Baran's ideas with hostility; Defence Communication Agency populated with telephone people, so Baran's ideas dead in the water
	- Licklider worked on the SAGE computer in the 1950s

Lyndon Johnson, in 1965 - directed agencies to support basic university research, and that centers of excellence should be created throughout the university

Lawrence Roberts - manager, ARPANET project, 1966

##### UK Political Context
-   Harold Wilson's fears of losing out on tech
-   Donald Davis, National Physical Laboratory are hired to research

IBM 2741, ca 1965
-   a direct connection in adjacent rooms at first
-   then local phone lines
-   but long distance rates interfere
-   high cost of communication makes users work fast, which undermines purpose of timesharing

-   Davis unveils packet switching in 1966 at a conference.
-   learns from a British military officer afterwards that it's already been invented by Baran
-   Baran uses words like 'survivable', 'kill', 'salvos', 'target'
-   Davis reads Baran's work, says, y'know, we don't need this in a civilian context
