##### This Relates to 
- [[How  Tumblr Creates Perverse Incentives]]
---
-   A perverse incentive is any incentive, both positive or negative, that has an unintended and undesirable result which is contrary to the interests of the buyer. I am looking into this regarding Section 230 and the web.
- In the case of Tumblr, I couln't help but recall how Tumblr was known to be a land of chaos, filled with various communities and strange unhindered content. 
	- This free reign was its main selling point to concumers as there was no need for users to hide or shild there weirdest thoughts.
