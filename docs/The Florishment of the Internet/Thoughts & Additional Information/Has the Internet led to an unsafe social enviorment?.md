The internet has created a complex and multifaceted social environment that can be both safe and unsafe, depending on how it is used. Here are some of the ways in which the internet has impacted our social environment negatively:  
	1. Cyberbullying and harassment: The anonymity of the internet has made it easier for people to engage in cyberbullying and online harassment, which can have serious consequences for individuals' mental health and well-being.
	2. Spread of misinformation: The internet has made it easier for false information to spread quickly and widely, which can have negative impacts on public health, politics, and other areas.
	3. Privacy concerns: The internet has made it easier for individuals and organizations to collect and use personal information, which can raise concerns about privacy and data security.
	4. Addiction and mental health concerns: The internet can be addictive, and excessive use can have negative impacts on mental health and well-being.
