The article reports that people are using artificial intelligence to create fake historical events and even entire historical narratives. By inputting data and images into AI models, users can generate realistic-looking photos and videos of events that never actually happened. This technology has raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and the need for better ways to authenticate historical records. The article also explores the ethical implications of using AI to manipulate historical records and the responsibility that comes with creating and sharing information.

##### What do I think about this? 
- This opens my eyes to a future that sadly is not impossible. a place where it becomes harder and harder for one to find the truth in a grand site of lies. 
- But I also cant help but to find it all laughable. because this new model of Ai generators has the potential to destroy the very mediums that supproted it. a major way these websites have content is due to content creator supporting themselves is by advertisers. Yet with AI these content creator sno longer have any way to supprot themselves.
	- I believe this will lead to a sudden downsizing in various online journalism communities akin to the downfall of the newspaper/magazine industry
