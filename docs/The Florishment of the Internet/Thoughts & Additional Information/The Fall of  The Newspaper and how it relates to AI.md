One thing histroy proves to us is that its bound to repeat. I see a repitition coming soon with the rise of AI.

The emergence of AI-generated content has the potential to disrupt the traditional media industry, including online journalism. 
- As AI becomes more advanced and capable of producing high-quality content, it may replace some human content creators and lead to job losses in the industry. 
	- Compaies have repeatedly done such things in order to reduce costs. For Example, Self automated cashiers, The layoff rate for game developers & animators after every project.
- With the lack of human hands There will always be a lack of human input in journalism for important things, such as researching, analyzing and interpreting information, and providing context and perspective. 
- It is also possible that the use of AI in journalism could lead to new opportunities and models for content creation and monetization taking away from the humans that used to do the job.

This is very similar to the Newspaper Industy that has undergone significant changes following the invention and popularization of the internet. 

What changes can we infer by refrencing the Newspaper Industry?

1. Consolidation and closures :The newspaper industry has undergone significant consolidation, with many newspapers merging or closing down entirely. This has led to a reduction in the number of journalists and newsrooms, which has in turn had an impact on the quality and diversity of news coverage.
2. Less public veiwership of Online articles: Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become major players in the news industry. Many people now rely on social media to stay informed about current events.
3. Changes in business models: With the decline in print circulation, many newspapers have had to shift their business models. Some have implemented paywalls for online content, while others have focused on advertising revenue or subscriptions to digital editions.
4. 1.  Decline in online news sources: The popularity of online news sources  led to a decline in print newspaper circulation. So there is no reason for this no to apply between AI and Online Articles.
