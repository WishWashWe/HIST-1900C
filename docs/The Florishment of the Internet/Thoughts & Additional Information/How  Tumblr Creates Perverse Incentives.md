- Tumblr, a social media platform that allows users to create and share content in a variety of forms, has been criticized for creating perverse incentives.Â 
	1. Attention-seeking behavior: Tumblr's design incentivizes users to create content that is likely to generate attention, such as provocative images or controversial opinions. This can lead to a race to the bottom, where users compete to create the most outrageous content to gain attention.
	2. Use of explicit content: Tumblr has been criticized for creating an environment where explicit content is encouraged, as it can generate more engagement and followers. This can create a perverse incentive for users to produce sexually explicit content, regardless of its artistic or creative merit.
	3. Algorithm-driven content: Tumblr's algorithmic recommendations can create perverse incentives for users to create content that is more likely to be recommended by the algorithm. For example, if the algorithm favors certain types of content, users may be incentivized to create more of that content to gain more visibility and followers.
	4. Promotion of harmful content: Tumblr's policy of allowing free expression can lead to the promotion of harmful content, such as hate speech or self-harm. In some cases, users may be incentivized to create or share this type of content in order to gain followers or attention.
