- My memex is split into 3 sections following the way way our class is programmed. Focusing on media in a certain point of time such as, [[The Pre-History of the Internet]] , [[The Beginnings of the Internet]] & [[The Florishment of the Internet]]. Each of these section above hold a folder to their name, to make it is easier for viwers to interact with my memex. To futher help with navigation each folder holds subsections within it in the names of Readings, Lecture Notes and Thoughts and Additional Information
	- **Readings** as the name implys holds the reading nothes done within each sector
	- **Lecture Notes** are fragmented or small notes taken in class that I belive were improtant or vital to my memex
	- **Thoughts and Additional Information** hold any additional knolege I held prior to this class about this sector as well as my atomic notes connecting my readings/Class Notes to certain ideas.
- Therefore if one wishes to find a certain reading note from the [[The Pre-History of the Internet]] they can easily navigate to it by clicking the menu -> [[The Pre-History of the Internet]] -> Readings -> Select your reading

- Thankyou for your time :)
