- **Medium** is something that carries something else:
	-   The medium for a message is as important as the message (both for its affordances or what it permits to write, but also for how it extends our abilities to think/see the world in new ways)
	-   ­How we classify media/messages has implications for power, control, and discipline (reflects and directs our thinking)
	-   ­writing and counting  are intimately connected
	-   ­the infrastructure for writing spills out, has impacts on society
	-   ­libraries reflect the world back to itself (for why else would extremists attack library readings & book lists?)

**Some of what we think we know:
- Early prehistoric ancestors (about 100,000 years ago) communicated with non-verbal gestures and an evolving system of spoken language.
- From the later pre-historic period (say 50,000)

- **Lascaux Cave Paintings
	- Are about 17,000 years old
	- Are in France
	- Were discovered in 1940, along with many, many other caves with paleolithic pictures in France and elsewhere
	- Are full of thousands of images, mostly animals
	- Pre-date the earliest writing by thousands of years

- The Communicative gesture is the creation of the Lascaux Cave Paintings. differ from formal language because:
	1. No grammar (rules for using them)
	2. No syntax (rules for order and sequence)

- “Pre-writing,” beginning 45,000 BCE
	- Evidence that Neanderthals and early humans had Culture.
	- Alexander Marshack: “Images and symbols, according to this theory, were markers of periodic and continuous cultural processes, of rites and of repetitive myths and stories, whereas notations of whatever sort was appropriately means of recording the passage of time in terms of culturally significant events.
	- As Schmant- Besserat notes, we also find in the period approximately 15,000 BCE artifacts like notched bones and tusks, - tallies
- Counters or markers used to keep track of goods, traded, transported or sold.
	- Preceded the development of full writing systems, but also led to them, because:
		1. Their use immediately precedes the appearance of an ancient writing system in **Sumeria (3200 BCE)
		2. Images of tokens appear as signs in the pictographic alphabet developed by the Sumarians
	- It Was the development of government a precursor to the development of writing

#### **Writing
- Sumerians of ancient Iraq/Syria developed Cuneiform in 3200 BCE
- The first FULL writing system.
- Capacity for abstraction
- Allow different objects, ideas, experiences to be represented with the same symbols.
- Mix semantic symbols (like $ or # or %) with phonetic symbols (based on the actual sounds we make h-o-r-s)

**Egyptian Hieroglyphics (3000 BCE)
- Also spoken and substantially phonetic
- Discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 allowed for the decipherment of hieroglyphics.

**Phoenicians (1500-1100 BCE)
- Credited with developing the first phonetic system of writing based on an alphabet 
- Phonetics=it looks like it sounds
- Many, many advantages to phonetic writing.

**Quipu (1400-1500 BCE)
- The medium was textiles actual sounds we make h-o-r-s)
