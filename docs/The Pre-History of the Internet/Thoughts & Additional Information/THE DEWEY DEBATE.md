### **Aruments given by series of library historians have been trying to clarify and contextualize the classification's origins.

###### Kurt F. Leidecker
- The debate was initiated in 1945 by **Kurt F. Leidecker. *******In the course of researching a biography of William Torrey Harris in the early 1940s. As Dewey had settled on a basic outline for his scheme, he still sought outside advice, especially for the identification of appropriate classes. On 9 May he wrote to William T. Harris for more information on his classification scheme. Harris responded four days later. "Perhaps the main advantages of my scheme are my plan of numbering such classes and the ease with which one masters the details after getting a glimpse of the general plan,"


##### Eugene E. Graziano
- The next contributor to the debate was Eugene E. Graziano, who had read Leidecker's biography of Harris. Because Dewey had adapted so heavily from Harris, and because Harris had studied the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel, Graziano concluded that Hegel's philosophy, whether Dewey knew it or not, constituted the philosophical foundation on which the Decimal Classification ultimately was based.


##### John Maass
- John Maass, had another opinion, While doing research on the United States Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Maass studied William Phipps Blake, a geologist and mining engineer whom the Centennial Commission had engaged in 1872 to organize its exhibition. On 25 May 1872, Maass notes, Blake submitted a scheme to the commission that organized the exhibition into ten "departments," each of which was subdivided into ten "groups," each of which was further divided into ten "classes." Maass notes that Blake's classification was published as a leaflet in February 1873 and likely was sent to Amherst. He also notes that a forty-two-page pamphlet elaborating the scheme was "mailed to professional men throughout the U.S." a month later. Based on this evidence, Maass argues that "Dewey copied that decimal notation from Blake . . . and cunningly covered his tracks."

##### John Comaromi's
- The most recent and most thoroughly researched entry into the historiographical debate surrounding the origins of the scheme is **John Comaromi's** book, The Eighteen Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classification (1976), which many scholars regard as the most definitive work so far on the subject. In his first chapter Comaromi evaluates arguments made by Leidecker, Graziano, and Maass, but for additional clues he also an analyzes the preface to Dewey's first edition of the DDC, the ideas of other classification experts like Leo LaMontagne, W. C. Berwick Sayers, and Henry Evelyn Bliss.
	- Comaromi judges the evidence Maass presents for his thesis "inconclusive," but finds Leidecker and Graziano's arguments highly plausible. He acknowledges Dewey probably drew on strong points from the classification schemes of Harris and Schwartz, the former because he used Arabic numerals for classes (and within classes arranged materials alphabetically by author surname), the latter because he used Arabic numerals for first and all subsequent divisions beyond the major classes to which he assigned numbers. Comaromi also acknowledges that Hegel's philosophy constituted the theoretical basis for Harris's system, and be cause Harris's system was "the most fruitful source of Dewey's conception," he concludes, Hegel "provided the philosophical underpinnings" of Dewey's system
