## Summary & Key Takeaways
-   This book examines the ways that media—and particularly new media—are experienced and studied as historical subjects
    -   This paper discusses the somewhat complicated relationship media has with history. Particularly one point of interest brought up within the essay is that the concept of media in history possesses a dualistic nature. Media is a product and producer of what we today call history.
        -   “First, media are themselves denizens of the past… But media are also historical because they are functionally integral to a sense of pastness.”
        -   Our sense of the past is created by media while that media is at the same time a product of a continuing process of “modernization” which started in the past. This complicated relationship created an interesting paradox for humanity.

-   **History:** information about what has happened, and integral to that definition is information, media, as because history can no longer be observed primarily, it must instead be communicated
    -   **Media**: “as socially realized structures of communication, where structures include both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice.”
        -   At the same time, history affects the conditions in which the media was created, as rarely does anyone crate media solely for the purpose of communicating history. Therefore we must consider not only what people say about the past but also why they would say that about the past.
