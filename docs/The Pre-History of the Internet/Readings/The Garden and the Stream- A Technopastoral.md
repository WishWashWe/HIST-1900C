## Summary & Keynotes

**What is A Garden and Stream?
- The “Garden” is like classic literature. It is things are meant to persist. It’s evergreen content,relevant and not recent. On the web, this can be a wiki or informational sources.
	- The Garden is an old metaphor associated with hypertext.
- A “Stream” is about conversation, sequence, and temporality. News, blogs, Twitter, Facebook. Based around capturing attention through the conversation: ‘this is what I’m interested in at the moment.’ 
	- In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center
