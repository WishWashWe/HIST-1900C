#### THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CATALOGUE
- (1668-626 BC) revealed that bibliographic information was recorded on tablets that served as a crude location device by recording title, number of tablets, distinct subdivision, and a location
	- Many attempts were made at standardisation of bibliographic entries among library catalogues but primitive methods of bibliographic control continued to persist
		- There was scanty information regarding catalogues and cataloguing during the Roman period even though public and private libraries were common. The Romans continued the methods established by Callimachus, continued without change during the first seven centuries of the Christian era
- The fall of Rome in the sixth century brought about the deliberate destruction and dispersion of the private, public and temple libraries. (300-1100 AD)
	- In The next ten centuries the libraries of the Western World were a small collection of manuscripts managed by monasteries established during this period.
	- These monasteries played a major role in education as they were the primary places for preservation and production in the middle ages
	- Since there was little need for library catalogues only inventory records were maintained
- Post twelfth century, the typical catalogue remained an inventory list but libraries of universities began with the library catalogue of the Sorbonne, university of Paris in 1289

- The 14th century catalogues included an author index appended to the inventory list which could be conceived as a true catalogue.

- In the fifteenth century, the concept of the finding list slowly emerged with the addition of author indexes

- The 16th century was influenced by great bibliographers like Gesner, Treflerus, and Maunsell who were framers of premier catalogues. Maunsell’s use of author’s surname was indicative of the changing concepts regarding names

- The 17th Century brought the Bodleian catalogue, an early form of the first dictionary catalogue with author and subjects filed in a single alphabetic order appeared, even though the single entry (author or title for anonymous) was the rule of the day.
	- It was the first printed catalogue compiled by Thomas James in 1605 in the classified form
- The beginning of the 19th century saw the emergence of the dictionary catalogue. But some sorts of subject entries were often visible in author catalogue with ‘catch word’ entries for anonymous works.
	- End of the late 19th century also witnessed the beginning of the card catalogue. The card catalogue was first introduced (in 1743) in France by Abbi Rosier at the Paris Academy of Science and at Bibliotheque du Roi,
- The early part of the 20th century saw the card catalogue displacing book form catalogues totally. Libraries in the uS also began adopting this format
	- Further development in catalogues came with that contained the cataloguing record in compacted micro-images and required a microform reader for viewing


MODERN TRENDS
- Libraries had begun using computer applications for their catalogues in the latter part of the 20th century.
	- Developments in information technology (IT) revolutionised the catalogue and consequently, the online public access catalogue (OPAC) emerged
