## Key Takeaways 
##### What is the Dewey Decimal Classification System?
It is a proprietary library classification system which allows new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on the subject. It was first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876
	- By 1996- around over 200,000 libraries in 135 countries were using the classification to organize their collections. In the United States alone, it was being used by 95 percent of public and school libraries, 25 percent of special libraries, and 25 percent of academic libraries
##### Why is Dewey's Classification Scheme so controversial?
***Although a debate about the origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme has been going on for generations, the historical consensus remains elusive. Why?

-   Reasons for a lack of consensus are not hard to find. Dewey himself established some parameters by dropping inconsistent hints during his lifetime and scattering inconclusive bits of information throughout his publications.
	- In a 1920 Library Journal article entitled "Decimal Classification Beginnings," for example, he described the moment of inspiration for the scheme in 1873. in the simplified form of spelling, Dewey used variously throughout his life are explained. However, Despite its wide circulation, however, the article fails to clarify the classification's origins.

    -   Dewey did acknowledge a debt to Sir Francis Bacon (who nearly three centuries earlier had hypothesized that all knowledge derived from memory, reason, and imagination and that these three invariably produced works of history, philosophy, and belles lettres), but he failed to locate his scheme in the continuum of library classification history and thus generally ignored the contributions and influences of his predecessors.

    -   Ever since library historians have been trying to clarify and contextualize the classification's origins. Strongly believing that Dewey did not create a decimal classification, and for the past half-century the historiography addressing its origins has tried to identify debts Dewey owed predecessors and contemporaries in classification history that he at one time or another acknowledged, overlooked, forgot, allegedly even deliberately ignored. **(This phenomena has earned the name the Dewey Debate)
