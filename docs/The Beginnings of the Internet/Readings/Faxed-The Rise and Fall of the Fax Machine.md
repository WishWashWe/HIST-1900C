### Summary 
- From its origins in the 1840's. Jonathan Coopersmith recounts the multigenerational, multinational story of the fax machine from its origins and describes how it changed the world, even through its decline in the twenty-first century.
	- Most people assume that the fax machine originated in the computer and electronics revolution of the late twentieth century, but it was actually invented in 1843. Almost 150 years passed between the fax’s invention in England and its widespread adoption in tech-savvy Japan, where it still enjoys a surprising popularity

### Key Take-Aways
- ##### Why is the History of the Fax machine impotant?
	- a global tale involving the diffusion of people, ideas, research, manufacturing, and applications from Europe to America to Japan and back. These shifts reflected larger movements of technology, manufacturing, capital, and consumption. A history limited to one country would be dreadfully incomplete. Where facsimile was, so was the center of telecommunications “high technology,”

##### What is a Fax machine & Why was the Fax Machine Important?
- The basic concept of a fax machine—  is a machine that electrically transmits an image— The three main components were, and remain, the scanner-transmitter, the transmitting medium, and the receiver-recorder.
- The fax machine helped create the accelerated communications, information flow, and the vibrant visual culture that characterize our current world.

#### Faxing as a "_failed_" technology
-  Over and over again, faxing’s promise to deliver messages instantaneously paled before easier, less expensive modes of communication as:
	- Inventors and entrepreneurs repeatedly failed in promoting fax in multiple marketplaces. Usually, even before offering products. 
	- Secondly, with the invention of the telegraphy, then radio and television, and finally digitalization in the form of email, the World Wide Web, and cell phones. Faxing had largely disappeared, having fallen victim to the same technological and economic processes that had created it.
- In both ways, fax was a “normal” technology, experiencing many unsuccessful attempts at commercialization and ultimately succeeded by technologies that provided the same or better services more easily, more cheaply, and with higher quality.
