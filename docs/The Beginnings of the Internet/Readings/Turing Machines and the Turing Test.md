### Summary
• Turing proposed the Imitation Game in 1950, to replace the  
somewhat-tricky philosophical question, “Can machines think?”  
	• Turing (1950) says that this question is “too meaningless to deserve discussion”  (p. 442).  
	• Thus the Imitation Game – nowadays called the Turing Test – which is an **operationalist** test of intelligence.  

### Key Points
**“Operationalism”** - refers to when we try and make something unmeasurable (like  thinking) and make it measurable by focusing on observable behaviour (like speaking).  

#### THE IMITATION GAME  
• He imagines two players: one is either a human or a machine; the other is the interrogator.  
• The interrogator asks the first player questions as in a viva voce examination.  
• If the interrogator cannot tell whether player one (a machine) is a human or a machine, the test is passed.  
• This later formulation of the Imitation Game – or some variant of it – that we usually think of when we hear “Turing Test” nowadays.
