#### Summary & Important Points
- This article focuses on the relationship between Ada Lovelace and Babbage as well as how the 1843 'notes' from Ada came to be.

Augusta Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage to create a description of Babbage’s unbuilt invention, the Analytical Engine, a highly advanced mechanical calculator often considered a forerunner of the electronic calculating computers of the 20th century. Ada Lovelace’s “Notes,” describing the Analytical Engine, published in Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs in 1843, contained a ground-breaking description of the possibilities of programming the machine to go beyond number-crunching to “computing” in the wider sense in which we understand the term today.
