- Alan M. Turing was born in London in  1912  
- He completed his undergraduate studies in mathematics at Cambridge University.  
- Completed a doctorate in mathematics at Princeton University under the  supervision of Alonzo Church.
- Well known for an influential paper on the Halting Problem, where he outlines what has come to be known as the Turing Machine. 
	 Using the Imitation Game, or Turing Test he explored the question whether machines can think. 

- In 1952, Turing was charged and  convicted with gross indecency after his house was burgled by Arnold Murray,with whom he’d had  a relationship. 
	- He was given the choice between  prison and estrogen therapy; he chose the latter.
	- Two years later in 1954, Turing was found dead, apparently having committed  suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide. This was deemed due to the estrogen therapy he was forced to undergo.
**Now**
