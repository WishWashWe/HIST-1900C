Alexander Graham Bell’s original goal was not to transmit speech, but to make it visible.
- Bell was keenly interested in deafness— his mother, Eliza, and future wife, Mabel, were both deaf— and he considered the education of the deaf his principal purpose in life. 

By recording sounds in a visible way, Bell hoped to help the deaf understand spoken words. 
- His father, the elocutionist Alexander Melville Bell, had developed a symbolic alphabet that represented the pronunciation of any phoneme with a diagram of the lips, tongue, and palate. He called it ‘‘Visible Speech.’’

 In 1874 , Bell constructed a macabre device to trace sound vibrations on paper using a charcoal pencil and a human cadaver’s severed ear. ‘‘If we can ﬁnd the deﬁnite shape due to each sound— what an assistance in teaching the deaf,’’ he enthused. Transmitting sound across distance was an afterthought for Bell. ‘‘I invented an apparatus by which the vibrations of speech could be seen,’’ he recalled in later years, ‘‘and it turned out to be a telephone.’’
