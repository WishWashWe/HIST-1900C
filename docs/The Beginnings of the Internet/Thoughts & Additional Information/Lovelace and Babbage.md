Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, conceived in the first half of the 19th century, are often seen as anticipating key design features used in modern computing, even though none of Babbage’s extraordinary devices was fully built in his lifetime. 

Augusta Ada Lovelace, née Byron, who worked against the restrictions on women of her day to successfully train as a mathematician, worked closely with Babbage to describe the more advanced of his Engines, the Analytical Engine, in a collection of “Notes” published in Taylor’s Scientific Memoirs in 1843.
	- Lovelace’s vision of the Engines’ potential for the future of computation may now be seen as having exceeded Babbage’s own vision for his machines in several key ways. She became the first person known to have crossed the intellectual threshold between conceptualizing computing as only for calculation on the one hand, and on the other hand, computing as we know it today: with wider applications made possible by symbolic substitution
