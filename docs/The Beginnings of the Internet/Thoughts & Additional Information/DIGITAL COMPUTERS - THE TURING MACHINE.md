Turing formalized the notions of computation and the algorithm using a mathematical model that’s come to be known as the Turing Machine.  
	• What is computation? According to Bermudez (2014), “Computation is what computers do, and according to many cognitive scientists, it is what minds do” (p. 13).  
	• He did this while addressing the Halting Problem: is there a procedure for determining whether a mathematical problem has a solution?  
	• Turing thought of computation as a mechanical procedure. Indeed, before the advent of digital computers, “computer” was a job description. Human computers were not allowed to deviate from their instructions in any way.  
	• Turing made the notion of a mechanical procedure more precise using the notion of an algorithm: an unambiguous set of rules that can be applied to an object/set of objects to  transform it in a definite and circumscribed way.
	
Turing's conceivation of an imaginary machine that we now call a Turing Machine also is shown to hold many component found in digital computers today.
• An infinitely long tape, with cells.  
• A machine head, which can move the tape one cell at a time to the right or left, delete cells, and type symbols into the cells.  
• A display window to display the state of the machine.  
• A machine table which contains instructions for the Turing Machine – what we would call a  “program” today.
