### "The Stentor Alliance"
In the previous millennium, there were 58 telephone companies in Canada.  
  - The largest telephone companies were part of a national alliance called Stentor Canadian Network Management, the “Stentor Alliance” or simply, “Stentor”.   
**These companies were:  
- British Columbia Telephone Company (BCTel)  
- Alberta Government Telephones (AGT)  
- Saskatchewan Telecommunications (SaskTel)  
- Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS) Bell Canada  
- The New Brunswick Telephone Company Limited (NBTel)  
- Maritime Telephone and Telegraph Company, Limited (MT&T)  
- The Island Telephone Company Limited (Island Tel)  
- Newfoundland Telephone Company Limited (NewTel).  

- The remaining companies were called independents because they were not full members of Stentor. There were 30 in Ontario, 16 in Quebec, one in BC and one in the North-West Territories. These companies provided both local and long-distance telecommunication services, as well as cellular service through affiliates, under tight federal regulation.
- The Stentor Alliance was terminated effective December 31, 1999.

### The Telephone Industry Now
- The Canadian business model mostly evolved to large holding companies owning local operations in many areas plus long-distance transmission facilities, and operating agreements between the companies for interconnect.  
  
BCTel, AGT, Ed Tel and Quebec Telephone merged to form TELUS.  
  
Bell Canada and the four telephone companies in the maritime provinces were reorganized as Bell Canada in metropolitan areas of Ontario and Quebec and Bell Aliant elsewhere, both majority owned by BCE.  
  
These companies are both expanding to provide national service. Both operate national cellular networks.
