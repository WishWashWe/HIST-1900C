The last section of Turing's article focuses on machines that learn. Turing thinks that “teaching” digital computers – rather than programming them – will be the best way to create machines capable of playing the game.  
	• Nowadays machine learning is a reality!  
	• We can train computer programs such as expert systems or neural networks by showing them examples of what we want them to learn.  
	• We use learning algorithms to teach them to get better at the tasks we’re training them on!
