#### Before Bell and any other version of the telephone...
- Any item that could transmit sound was named the telephone
	- Ear Horn
	- Tin can and string: the lovers telephone
	- Weedstone- Enchanted lyre: if a piano is played upstairs the sound is transmitted below in the lyre.

**Page effect:** How vowells stood in frequencies within soundwaves  
- The results of these items led to financial benefits to existing telegraphy
- Different signals sounding different notes could be send down a single wire
- More messages on the same time
This evolved into string phones, megaphones, speaking tubes, ear trumps, sound resonators, wave theory of electromagnetism

**Missing Piece:
- Variable resistance: M Clarac: finds out the if you put pressure in powdered carbon you can regulate electric transmission: 
- Theory of language:

**Telephones had a bad rep: 
- Bell- fearing that he would be ridiculed he did not mention his work on the telephone
- This leads to a mess in patents-caveats and court cases
- Philip Reiss joins the fight with a working(somewhat)telephone. This disrupts electromagnet that gets pushed along. It transmits sound. 

#### Grey vs Bell
**Grey**: creates a telephone first but does not patent it yet. He is more focused on telegram business

**Bell** wishes to marry his student and is only allowed to do so if the telegram is made and patented. He gets a patent but the telegram does not exist yet.
	- To advertise the telephone: They use phrases used by everyone. Mary had a little lamb, to be or not to be
	- Bell is able to create a proper receiver but his transmitter still is not finished

Edison joins the scene. Berliner both devices go head to head. this leads to more legal battles
- Social necesisity for the telephone
- Improving the economics of telegraph
- Leads to the emergence of the modern corporation
